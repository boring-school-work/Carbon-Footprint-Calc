## Overview

- The theme is **climate change**. The concepts under climate change discussed from the project include:

  - Climate science
  - Climate change
  - Climate mitigation
  - Climate adaptation

- The goal of the project is to create a program modeling any aspect of the presented concepts, related to this theme.
- Sample project ideas:

  - Create a program that models an approach to mitigating climate change.
  - A program that illustrates some aspect of climate science.
  - A program that models an approach to adapting to climate change.

## Criteria For Grading

- The project should apply the object-oriented programming paradigm and include at least four classes (and not more than ten classes) that interact with each other in a variety of ways. Most of your classes must have substantial/significant logic in at least one of the methods (i.e. not only getter/setter methods)
- The project should involve the use of inheritance and/or interfaces.
- The project should involve the use of some kind of Java collection
